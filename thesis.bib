abstract = {The design and evaluation of a high performance soft keyboard
for mobile systems are described. Using a model to predict the
upper-bound text entry rate for soft keyboards, we designed a
keyboard layout with a predicted upper-bound entry rate of 58.2
wpm. This is about 35% faster than the predicted rate for a QWERTY
layout. We compared our design (OPTI) with a QWERTY layout in a
longitudinal evaluation using five participants and 20 45-minute
sessions of text entry. Average entry rates for OPT1 increased from
17.0 wpm initially to 44.3 wpm at session 20. The average rates
exceeded those for the QWERTY layout after the 10 session (about 4
hours of practice). A regression equation (R = .997) in the form of
the power-law of learning predicts that our upper-bound prediction
would be reach at about session 50.},
