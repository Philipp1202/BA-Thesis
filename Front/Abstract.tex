\chapter{Abstract}
Text-entry is one of the most common forms of computer-human interaction and indispensable for many tasks such as word processing and some approaches to multimedia retrieval. The conventional keyboards everybody knows have long-established as the main text input method for desktop and laptop computers and even for touchscreen based devices they are very useful. But when it comes to virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), conventional keyboards might not be the best solution. As things stand now, these two technologies lack of tactile feedback and accurate finger tracking. As a result, text input for VR and AR is still an area of active research.\\
In recent years, word-gesture keyboards (also called slide-to-type keyboards) have been introduced in most major smartphone operating systems. These keyboards do not work with tapping on single keys to input single characters, but with gestures to input whole words. The question now is whether they can also perform well in VR and AR.
