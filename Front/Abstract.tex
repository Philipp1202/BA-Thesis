\chapter{Abstract}
Text-entry is one of the most common forms of computer-human interaction and indispensable for many tasks such as word processing and some approaches to multimedia retrieval. The normal keyboards everybody knows have long established as the main text input method for desktop and laptop computers and even for touchscreen based devices they are very useful. But when it comes to virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), with todays technology, it lacks of tactile feedback and accurate finger tracking. As a result, text input for VR and AR is still an area of active research.\\
In recent years, word-gesture typing/ slide-to-type keyboards have been introduced in most major smartphone operating systems. Could this also be an efficient text input method for VR/AR?
