\chapter{Acknowledgments}
I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Heiko Schuldt for the opportunity to write this thesis in the Databases and Information Systems Groups. Further, I would especially like to thank my supervisor Florian Spiess for giving me great advice, helpful feedback and clear answers to the many questions I had. Finally, I would also like to thank my family, friends and fellow students for helping me with the evaluation and giving me motivation to give my best for this thesis.
