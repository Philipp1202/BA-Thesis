\section*{Feedback}
Thanks, it works \& feels very good!\\
Personally, I'd like to see the automatically added space (e.g. visual indication in form of a color?)\\
A setting to disable/prioritise certain words (e.g. make ``the'' a higher priority than ``thee'').\\
When I want the word ``the'' the recommended word was ``thee''. Since ``the'' is more common, I would have preferred if it would suggest ``the'' by default instead of ``thee''.\\
Maybe two separate buttons for deleting a word and deleting only a character might be useful.\\
If the last typed character is a space, maybe have a placeholder symbol that visually shows that.\\
Some additional nice looking things in the 3D VR room! It looks very experimental now $:$-)\\
To question 1 in evaluation: if it supports the langauge I need (strongly agree, 5)\\
Hitbox could be larger (of the keyboard).\\
Writing single-letter words works differently (no added space) to $>$2-letter words.\\
The automatically created words when using slide-to-type are somtimes quite obscure, especially when compared to the other suggestions. E.g. thee instead of the.\\
Overall it was surprisingly intuitive to use.\\
I really like the visual feedback being provided, I could tell a lot of thought went into user friendliness.\\
Sometimes it was unclear where the current cursor is.\\
the $\rightarrow$ thee\\
Needs a better differentiation for very similar words or words with a double vowel.\\
long words are hard to write.\\
